# batchFu
GOAL: create a set of scripts for doing batch jobs in the GIMP

I have 101 images that I need to scale down to be 500px wide,
so I started writing a batch scaler.

I realized this might be useful to someone, so I'm putting it
up here while I write the batch scaling script.

I apologise for inflicting the current state of this repo on the
world. To make amends I'll leave you with links to some very helpful
TinyScheme docs. I'd be lost without these.
ALMOST all the script-fu reference you'll ever need (thanks kevin):
http://www.ve3syb.ca/wiki/doku.php/software:sf:writing#internally_defined_functions
And a little bit more (thanks ben):

I'll come back and improve the documentation when it actually does the thing I want it to do.
